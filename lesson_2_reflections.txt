What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A space is created in which I can save commits and, therefore,
track my changes to the file over time. This is imporant because
 I can track what I have done and easily make changes if I have
 made a mistake somewhere.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the
repository because it is like an intermediate step before making
a commit in the repository. It is valuable because it allows you
to specify exactly what changes you'd like to use for a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

The staging area allows you to specify exactly what changes
you'd like to use for a commit. Using it helps a developer
insure that they have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful in cases where you'd like to create
experimental changes or alternate versions of files. This
allows you to do the changes without worrying about messing up
the original version. This would allow you to take more risks
and be a bit more bold in your experimentations because you
don't need to worry about mistakes as much as you would
otherwise.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help me visualize the branch structure by giving me
a visual representation of how it all works. By using a diagram,
I can see how the different branches relate to the master branch
and where they are in relation to the commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
